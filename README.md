# Subtitle corrector

Allows to shift each subtitle of a .srt or .txt file (the VLC's corrector is bugged !)

Put the file in the root dir (subtitleCorrector/)
Open subtitleCorrector.py with a text editor
Change the initialization of the shiftTime variable
Run the script with Python3
Your new file is in the root dir
